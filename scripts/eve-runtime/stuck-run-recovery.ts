/**
 * Re-enqueues Workflow runs whose next step lost its queue job.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - `STUCK_RETRY_AFTER_MS`, `STUCK_STEP_STARTED_AFTER_MS`, `STUCK_RUN_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS`: limits.
 * - `findStuckRuns`: active runs whose last event is a retry nobody picked up, or a step start far
 *   older than any step may run.
 * - `startStuckRunRecovery`: scans on an interval and enqueues each found run the way the world's
 *   own startup recovery did; returns a stop function.
 * - `findInFlightRuns`, `requeueInFlightRuns`: startup recovery of the runs interrupted mid-flight
 *   only; parked sessions and sleeps are left to the events that wake them.
 *
 * Key construct:
 * - On 1 October 2026 a turn step recorded `step_retrying`, but the follow-up job that should have
 *   run it again was written to a closed HTTP connection and never existed. Workflow's own backstop
 *   skips steps that already retried, so the run stayed pending and the private chat was silent
 *   for 8.5 hours, until a restart re-enqueued every active run. This scan does the same for the
 *   runs that need it, without a restart. Replay is idempotent, so a duplicate enqueue is safe.
 * - Runs that wait on a hook, a sleep or a parked session end on other events and are never touched.
