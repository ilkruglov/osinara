/**
 * Retention of finished per-turn Workflow runs.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - `pruneTerminalWorkflowRuns`: deletes a bounded batch of old finished turn runs via a client.
 * - `pruneConfiguredTerminalWorkflowRuns`: the same over the configured Workflow database.
 *
 * Key constructs:
 * - Every Eve turn is its own run (`turnWorkflow`) and every turn arms a `sessionTimeoutWorkflow`
 *   run; both finish and are never touched again, but session retention deletes only the session
 *   run itself. On 26 September 2026 the production Workflow database held 4 200 finished turn
 *   runs (2.3 GB of events and steps out of 3.5 GB), and the disk check before a deploy failed.
 * - A finished run is kept for `WORKFLOW_TURN_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` for diagnosis, then removed with
 *   the same per-run projections as a session run. A hook with an open retention window keeps it.
 * - Session runs (`workflowEntry`) stay with the application's own session retention.
