/**
 * Retention of finished per-turn Workflow runs.
 *
 * Exports:
 * - `pruneTerminalWorkflowRuns`: deletes a bounded batch of old finished turn runs via a client.
 * - `pruneTerminalWorkflowRunsWithin`: full batches one after another within a time budget.
 * - `pruneConfiguredTerminalWorkflowRuns`: one budgeted sweep over the configured Workflow database.
 *
 * Key constructs:
 * - Every Eve turn is its own run (`turnWorkflow`) and every turn arms a `sessionTimeoutWorkflow`
 *   run; both finish and are never touched again, but session retention deletes only the session
 *   run itself. On 26 September 2026 the production Workflow database held 4 200 finished turn
 *   runs (2.3 GB of events and steps out of 3.5 GB), and the disk check before a deploy failed.
 * - A finished run is kept for `WORKFLOW_TURN_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` for diagnosis, then removed with
 *   the same per-run projections as a session run. A hook with an open retention window keeps it.
 * - Two days, down from seven (3 October 2026): a turn run carries ~0.3 MB of events and steps
 *   (load run, stress/load-families), so a week at 1 000 families of 100 messages a day would hold
 *   ~200 GB; incidents so far were read the same day.
 * - One batch of 50 a minute removes at most 72 000 runs a day, and every turn finishes two runs:
 *   1 000 families of 100 messages a day make ~200 000. A sweep therefore takes batches until one
 *   comes back short or 20 seconds pass, inside the same minute lock.
 * - Session runs (`workflowEntry`) stay with the application's own session retention.
 * - The same sweep releases queue jobs whose run is gone, by either deletion (`workflow-orphan-jobs.ts`).
