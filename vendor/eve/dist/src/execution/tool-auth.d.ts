 * Mirrors the connection authorization flow (see

 * per-step token cache and framework-owned callback URL by the tool's
 * path-derived name and provider key instead of a connection name. All the shared
 * machinery — principal resolution, cache reads/writes, the park/resume
 * webhook dance, and the loop guard — lives in
 * `runtime/connections/scoped-authorization.ts`; this module is the thin
 * execution-layer adapter that wraps one tool's `execute`.

 *
 * On a thrown provider-scoped authorization request — implicit from
 * `ctx.getToken(provider)` or explicit via `ctx.requireAuth(provider)` — the
 * wrapper either fails terminally (token rejected immediately after sign-in)
 * or evicts the rejected token from the per-step cache and starts the
 * interactive flow, returning an `AuthorizationSignal` to park the turn.
 * Interactive strategies never rethrow the raw `Required` into the model: if
 * no callback URL can be minted, they fail with a classified
 * {@link ConnectionAuthorizationFailedError} instead. Non-interactive
 * strategies rethrow the original error because they have no consent flow to
 * park on.
