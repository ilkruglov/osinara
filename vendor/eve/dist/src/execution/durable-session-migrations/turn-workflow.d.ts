/**
 * Turn workflow input migrations.
 *
 * The driver workflow can stay pinned while per-turn child workflows
 * route to latest, so the child workflow run input is a durable wire
 * shape newer code must read. Inputs written before
 * {@link TURN_WORKFLOW_INPUT_VERSION} carry no `version`; the chain reads
 * them as version 0 and the registered v0 → v1 migration lifts the flat
 * shape into the current input, so a turn dispatched by an older
 * deployment still runs after a rollout. Future shape changes bump
 * {@link TURN_WORKFLOW_INPUT_VERSION} and append a v{N} → v{N+1} migration.
