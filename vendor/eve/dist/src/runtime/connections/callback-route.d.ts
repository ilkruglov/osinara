/**
 * Framework-shipped callback route used by in-turn interactive
 * connection authorization.
 *
 * The route at {@link EVE_CONNECTION_CALLBACK_ROUTE_PATTERN} is the
 * redirect target the workflow body hands to the IdP via
 * `startAuthorization`. When the IdP redirects the user's browser back
 * with the OAuth `code`/`state` (or whatever payload the protocol
 * carries), this handler:
 *
 * 1. Parses the inbound request into a JSON-serializable
 *    {@link AuthorizationCallback} (params only — never request headers).
 * 2. Calls `resumeHook(token, payload)` to wake the suspended workflow.
 * 3. Renders the standard "Authorization complete" landing page so the
 *    user sees a friendly UI instead of an empty `202 Accepted`.
 *
 * Owning this route in the framework - instead of routing the IdP at the
 * workflow runtime's raw `/.well-known/workflow/v1/webhook/:token` -
 * keeps the public surface namespaced under eve and lets the framework
 * decide delivery policy (auth, throttling, logging) for connection
 * callbacks without leaking generic workflow primitives to the public
 * internet.
