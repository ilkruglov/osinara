/**
 * Wraps one inbound channel HTTP request in an OTel `SERVER` span.
 *
 * The span is named for the low-cardinality registered `routeKey`
 * (`"POST /eve/v1/session/:sessionId"`), never the concrete URL, while the
 * `http.route` attribute carries only the path template — the OTel HTTP
 * semantic convention reserves `http.route` for the route template alone,
 * with the method in `http.request.method`. The span is started from the
 * context extracted off the incoming request headers so an upstream
 * `traceparent` becomes its parent and nested channel and Workflow spans
 * (`hook.resume` and outgoing HTTP) become its descendants.
 *
 * The handler runs inside the span's active context. When it returns, the
 * response status is recorded and a `>= 500` status marks the span as an
 * error. A thrown handler is recorded once and rethrown — handler
 * exceptions that eve already converts to a JSON 500 return normally and
 * are recorded by `logError` against this active span, so they are not
 * recorded a second time here. The span always ends in `finally`, without
 * waiting for `event.waitUntil()` work or streamed response bodies.
 *
 * Emitting these spans is opt-in: unless authored instrumentation enables it
 * via `traceChannelRequests: true`, the handler runs with no span (`undefined`)
 * and no context extraction — a true bypass, not a non-recording span.
 *
 * This is observability-only: it never changes the response and performs no
 * synchronous span export in the request path, adding only minimal in-process
 * tracing overhead.
