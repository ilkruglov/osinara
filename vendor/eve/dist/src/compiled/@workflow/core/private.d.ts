     * event log.
     *
     * The problem: each of these resolutions reaches workflow code after a
     * different, workload-dependent number of microtask hops. A buffered hook
     * payload is observed via the async hook iterator (`yield await this`),
     * costing extra hops; a `wait_completed` resolves with fewer, and a reused
     * sleep can resolve in an entirely earlier loop iteration; a step result is
     * gated on hydration whose cost varies between replays of the SAME
     * invocation — the first replay pays the full decrypt/decompress/revive,
     * while later replays sharing the invocation's `ReplayPayloadCache`
     * memo-hit small primitive results and resolve in one or two hops. Either
     * way, the resolution that the committed event log ordered first can lose a
     * `Promise.race` (or a `useStep` ULID allocation) to a faster- or
     * already-resolved competitor, diverging from the log and surfacing as
     * `CorruptedEventLogError`.

     * The fix is a strict, deterministic delivery order anchored on
     * event-log position: a delivery does not resolve to the workflow until
     * every relevant earlier-in-log delivery has been delivered. Because the
     * gate is "the earlier delivery resolved", not "won a timing race", the
     * outcome is independent of microtask hops, hydration/decryption time,
     * and `Promise.race` argument order. Which earlier kinds a delivery defers
     * behind is spelled out on {@link awaitEarlierDeliveries}.

 * is what keeps a `Promise.race` — or the ULID a follow-up `useStep` draws on
 * a concurrent branch — deterministic and aligned with the committed event
 * log, independent of microtask-hop counts, hydration time, or race-argument
 * order. When this delivery does have to wait, it also yields a macrotask
 * afterwards so the earlier delivery's consumer can run to its own next
 * suspension point first; see the comment at that `await` for why ordering the
 * `resolve()` calls alone is not enough.
 *
 * What counts as "defers behind" is {@link gatesOn}, shared with
 * {@link computeResolvesOnItsOwn} so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * One asymmetry: a STEP result skips any earlier delivery that is UNARMED,
 * i.e. a buffered hook payload no consumer has claimed. Such a payload is
 * delivered only when the workflow next reads the hook, and reaching that read
 * very commonly requires the step result itself (`await stepX()` before the
 * read). Gating the step on it would stall the workflow until the barrier's
 * idle safety net fires, which then releases every delivery queued behind that
 * payload at once — losing exactly the race this ordering exists to protect.
 * Waits and hooks keep gating on unclaimed payloads: for them, waiting for the
 * claim IS the ordering guarantee (a `wait_completed` must not preempt a
 * payload the log ordered first).
 *
 * The skip is direct, never transitive. A step still gates on an earlier ARMED
 * wait or hook, including one that is itself parked behind an unclaimed
 * payload. Skipping those too would invert log order for the commonest shape
 * there is: a workflow that creates a hook it does not read on this branch,
 * races `step` against `sleep`, and has the log say the sleep won. The step
 * would then overtake the wait, both branches would swap the correlation ids
 * they draw next, and replay would diverge — see
 * `step-delivery-ordering.test.ts`. Waiting instead is safe because the
 * payload's own idle safety net retires it and the whole chain then delivers
 * in log order; {@link hasParkedCommittedDelivery} deliberately reports such a
 * step as not self-resolving so that idle stays reachable.
 *
 * "The whole chain then delivers in log order" rests on the PAYLOAD's barrier
 * being retired before that of anything parked behind it. That order is
 * structural: safety-net retirements go through one per-context dispenser that
 * only ever retires the lowest-index entry at delivery idle, and every
 * retirement that wakes a chain flips {@link hasParkedCommittedDelivery} back
 * to true, re-blocking the dispenser until the chain has drained — see
 * {@link ensureBarrierSafetyNet}. (This used to rest on the FIFO of one idle
 * poll per barrier, which held for a single parked segment but decayed to
 * timing noise with several — the release order, and therefore the ULIDs
 * drawn by the woken branches, then depended on how much log the replay had
 * loaded. storm-log-replay.test.ts replays a production log corrupted exactly
 * that way.)
