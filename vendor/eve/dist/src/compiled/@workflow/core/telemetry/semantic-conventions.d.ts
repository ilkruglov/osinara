/**
 * OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for Vercel Workflow telemetry.
 *
 * This module provides standardized telemetry attributes following OpenTelemetry semantic conventions
 * for instrumenting workflow execution, step processing, and related operations. Each exported function
 * creates a properly formatted attribute object that can be used with OpenTelemetry spans.
 *
 * The semantic conventions are organized into several categories:
 * - **Workflow attributes**: Track workflow lifecycle, status, and metadata
 * - **Step attributes**: Monitor individual step execution, retries, and results
 * - **Queue attributes**: Instrument message queue operations
 * - **Deployment attributes**: Capture deployment environment information
 *
 * All attribute functions are type-safe and leverage existing backend types to ensure
 * consistency between telemetry data and actual system state.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Attribute from './telemetry/semantic-conventions.js';
 *
 * // Set workflow attributes on a span
 * span.setAttributes({
 *   ...Attribute.WorkflowName('my-workflow'),
 *   ...Attribute.WorkflowOperation('start'),
 *   ...Attribute.WorkflowRunStatus('running'),
 * });
 *
 * // Set step attributes
 * span.setAttributes({
 *   ...Attribute.StepName('process-data'),
 *   ...Attribute.StepStatus('completed'),
 *   ...Attribute.StepAttempt(1),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/} OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions
